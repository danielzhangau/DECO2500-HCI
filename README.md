# Time-Management-Application-Design
UQ DECO2500 Human Computer Interaction

Models of action, perception, cognition and interaction in human-machine systems. Methods of interaction analysis and interaction representation. Human-machine system evaluation. Practical implementation. Introduction to user and use-centred design principles. Broader topics may include: societal considerations, groupware, multimedia, media perspectives.

## SYSTEM CONCEPT STATEMENT
The team aims to design and develop an engaging mobile application with minimal cognitive
demands, for university students that promotes efficient time management by mitigating
distraction and aiding task management through incentivisation which, in turn, enables users to
study in a manner that is more productive within the same time constraints.
## SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY DESCRIPTION
Time management focuses on an individualâ€™s ability to prioritise tasks and work effectively within
a given time frame (Mindtools, 2017). Thus, it was necessary for the team to take these two
aforementioned factors into consideration when developing an time management application.
With that being said, the functionality of the application is able to be split into four main categories:
task management, time management, progress and incentives.

developed work through interaction design and human-centered design process to develop an interactive system - an application (FOCUS) in a group of size four. Completed the three 'cycles' of the process:
- Report 1: Contextual Inquiry, Conceptual Design, Low Fidelity Prototype (Paper prototyping) & Initial Evaluation
- Report 2: Adding in UX, Medium Fidelity Prototype developed by Adobe XD & adding Rigorous Empirical Evaluation
- Report 3: High Fidelity Prototype (fully functioned) & adding Expert Evaluations from other group's member

# What I learned
- The fundamental guidelines and heuristics of user interface design to inform the creation of strong user interfaces, from major principles like discoverability and affordances to frameworks like distributed cognition and task analysis.
- The stages of the design life cycle, including needfinding and requirements gathering; individual and group brainstorming; low- to high-fidelity prototyping; and qualitative, quantitative, and heuristic evaluation of human-computer interfaces.
- The power of human-computer interaction in the modern world and the role it can play in promoting equity, accessibility, and progress.
